# Overview  
Goal scale is a SPA app that ask a series of questions to define and achive the goals of the end user.

# Core Features  
- Ask the following questions in this particular order:
    - GOAL (who I choose to be / what I choose to be)
    - PURPOSES (what is the main motivations for carrying out the goal)
    - POLICIES / PRINCIPLES (how I choose to become it)
    - IDEAL SCENE (what I choose to have when I achieve this goal)
    - CURRENT SCENE (what I have now)
    - DEVIATIONS (list of differences between the current image and the ideal image)
    - SITUATION (the main deviation from the ideal image)
    - VALUABLE FINAL PRODUCT(S) (the result needed to correct the situation â€” something that can be exchanged outside the area for something in return)
    - STATISTICS (the figures to be achieved to correct the situation)
    - WHY (the main cause(s) of the situation)
    - PLAN (brilliant idea to correct the situation)
    - PROGRAM (the big solution to a problem given by a defined plan. The little problems inside that big solution are solved by projects and inside the projects the littler-littler problems are solved by orders)
    - PROJECTS (these are a series of guiding steps which if followed will result in a full and successful accomplishment of the program target)
    - ORDERS (what are issued to get the actions called done so that a valuable final product results)

# User Experience  
- The user can print a final PDF report of his final plan to achieve his goal
- The user can export, at any step, the actual already filled form to save it
- The user can import an already full or not filled form to continue or edit it

# Technical Architecture  
- **Main framework**: Nuxt (Vue.js)
- **No data persitance**: everything is covered by import/export capability
- **Internationalization**: Support EN, FR, DE locales (Swiss German standards)
- **Package management**: Use pnpm for nuxt project directories
- **Form library**: Vueform using JSON schema definition to guarantee maintenance. (See Appendix)
- **UI Theme**: Use TailwindCSS and Lucide.dev icons
- **Deployment**: Single HTML/JS bundle

# Development Roadmap  
- Create a hello world page with skeleton theme
- Integrate the two first questions thanks to Vueform
- Implement export fonction at any step
- Implement import step at the beginning of the form
- Integrate all other questions
